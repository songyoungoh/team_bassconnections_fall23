# Bass Connections 2023-2024
We are Bass Connections Team working on tracking climate change with satellites and artificial intelligence at Duke University. This repository provides an image classification model using PyTorch. It utilizes a ResNet-50 architecture and is trained on the EuroSAT dataset released by Helber et al. in 2019. Our evaluation metrics include a confusion matrix and accuracy rate on the test data.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the EuroSAT dataset, which offers satellite images categorized into 10 distinct classes. The dataset is available for public access and can be found on the [EuroSAT GitHub repository](https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT). For our specific project, the data is split into a training and testing set with an 80%-20% ratio.

The dataset is organized in the following directory hierarchy:

```
Train_Test_Splits
│
├── train
│   ├── AnnualCrop
│   ├── [Other Classes]
│
└── test
    ├── AnnualCrop
    ├── [Other Classes]
```

you need to download it and unzip the file. Then adjust your data path in the config.yaml

## Requirements
matplotlib==3.7.2
numpy==1.23.5
pandas==2.0.3
protobuf==4.23.4
scikit_learn==1.3.0
seaborn==0.13.0
torch==2.0.1
torchvision==0.15.2

use pip to install all the requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. To do EDA, use 'eda.ipynb' in the 'notebooks' folder. This would give you a good sense of the EuroSAT data.
2. After doing EDA, use python files in 'src' folder to train and evaluate a model.
   * data.py: This file is to read the dataset from the given specified directory and return dataloaders along with dataset sizes.
   * model.py: This file is to import a pre-trained ResNet50 model and train it by iterating 15 epochs with a learning rate of 0.00001.
